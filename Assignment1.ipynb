    "\n",
    "Welcome to Assignment 1! In this assignment, you'll dive into the world of statistical analysis using Python.  We'll move beyond theoretical concepts and focus on practical application. You'll learn how to calculate key statistical measures and use them for real-world tasks like outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Revise the concepts and equations:**  You'll implement code from scratch to compute essential statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (IQR).\n",
    "* **Calculating Basic Statistics:**  You'll implement functions (and use powerful libraries like NumPy and SciPy) to compute essential statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (IQR).\n",
    "* **Outlier Detection:** You'll apply the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and filter outliers from datasets, a crucial step in data cleaning and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you'll have a strong foundation in performing statistical calculations in Python and applying these techniques to understand and refine data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "Please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Clarity:** Your code should be well-formatted, easy to understand, and include meaningful variable names.\n",
    "- **Docstrings:**  Use docstrings to document your functions and explain their purpose, arguments, and return values.\n",
    "- **Testing:**  Use the same given data example of your code to demonstrate its functionality.\n",
    "- **NOTE:** Answer in the same notebook with the given examples.\n"
